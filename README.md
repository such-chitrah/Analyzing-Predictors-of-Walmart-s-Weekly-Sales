# Analyzing Predictors of Walmart's Weekly Sales
Analyzing data to identify key factors influencing the outcome variable through employing various statistical tests including hypothesis testing and feature analysis techniques.

# BackgroundÂ 
In our daily lives, grocery shopping stands as a cornerstone, heavily influenced by the principles of supply and demand. The unpredictability of surging demand for certain goods can significantly impact a company's net sales. To mitigate these challenges, companies rely on analysts to predict demand based on various factors, including historical sales data, anticipating when, where, and how much of certain goods will be required.

A prime example of this volatility emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic when there was a scarcity of essential items like toilet paper and medicines. To preempt such scenarios in the future, companies must strategize to stock up on critical products. For instance, Walmart, a prominent US-based department store chain, is keen on accurately forecasting sales and demand.

# Aim
The dataset, sourced from GitHub contains historical sales information from 45 diverse Walmart locations, forms the foundation of this project. Through this data analysis, including hypothesis testing and various tests applied to all potential influencing features, the aim is to identify the key drivers impacting weekly sales trends.

By deciphering these pivotal features, this analysis will not only provide crucial insights into the factors influencing sales but also offer a blueprint for refining and optimizing a Machine Learning algorithm. Leveraging these identified key features as inputs for training the ML model will significantly enhance its predictive performance. This enhanced model will enable Walmart to forecast demand more accurately, better allocate resources, and strategically manage inventory, ultimately ensuring improved stock availability and enhanced customer satisfaction during critical periods.
